## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
Agile and Waterfall are two of the most widely used project management methodologies in software development, each with distinct approaches to planning, executing, and managing projects.

Waterfall Methodology
Waterfall is a linear, sequential approach to software development, where each phase must be completed before the next begins. This approach is heavily structured and follows a set order: requirements, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance.

Advantages:
Clear Structure and Documentation: Each phase has clear deliverables, and detailed documentation is created, making it easy to understand progress and project requirements.
Predictable Timeline and Budget: Since each phase is defined at the start, it’s easier to estimate the timeline and budget accurately, which is beneficial for fixed-scope projects.
Easier to Manage for Simple or Stable Projects: For projects with clear, unchanging requirements, Waterfall is simpler to manage as there is less need for frequent adjustments.
Disadvantages:
Inflexible to Change: Since phases are sequential, it’s difficult to accommodate changes once a phase is completed, making Waterfall less suitable for projects with evolving requirements.
Late Testing: Testing occurs only after development is complete, which means that bugs or design flaws might be discovered late in the process, leading to costly fixes.
Limited Customer Feedback During Development: Customer involvement is usually limited to the requirements phase, so feedback can only be incorporated after the project is complete, which risks misalignment with customer needs.
Agile Methodology
Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to software development, designed to accommodate changes and continuously deliver value. Agile is organized into cycles, called sprints, where small portions of the project are developed, tested, and reviewed continuously.

Advantages:
Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile is highly flexible, allowing changes to requirements and priorities throughout the development process. This adaptability makes it ideal for projects with uncertain or evolving requirements.
Continuous Testing and Feedback: Agile’s iterative nature means that testing and feedback occur continuously, allowing early detection and resolution of issues.
